# Firebase Data Access Before Listener Initialization

This repository demonstrates a common error in Firebase applications: attempting to access data from a listener before it has completely initialized.  The `bug.js` file contains code illustrating this mistake, while `bugSolution.js` presents the corrected approach.

## Problem

The Firebase Realtime Database's `on()` method is asynchronous. Directly accessing data within the callback function before the data is loaded leads to errors.  This issue is often overlooked, causing unexpected behavior and app crashes.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the data is available before processing it. Techniques such as validating the snapshot or using promises can guarantee that you only handle data once it is retrieved from Firebase.
