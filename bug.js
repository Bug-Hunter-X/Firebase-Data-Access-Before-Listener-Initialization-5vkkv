The Firebase SDK might throw an error if you try to access data from a listener before the listener has fully initialized. This can happen if you try to use data from a listener within the same function where you attach the listener.  Here's an example of this:

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
db.ref('path/to/data').on('value', (snapshot) => {
  console.log(snapshot.val()); // May throw an error if data isn't loaded yet
  processData(snapshot.val());
});

function processData(data){
  // process data
}
```

This is because the `on()` method is asynchronous; it doesn't immediately return the data. The callback function within `on()` executes only when the data is eventually available.
